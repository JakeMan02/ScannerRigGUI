# ScannerRigGUI
This is a GUI that I made using Python's Tkinter for my summer internship in 2023!

This GUI uses Jupyter Notebook in order to run.
After downloading and opening Jupyter Notebook, open the file ScannerRigGUI.ipynb.
Click run and the Gui will launch. It launches minimized, so you will have to click on the tab for it in your taskbar.
You will only be able to use New Configuration and it will not successfully save anything as that is not currently uploaded to this repository.
